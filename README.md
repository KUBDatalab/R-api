This is an introduction to working with APIs in R, designed for participants with
limited programming experience. It can be taught in 2 hours.

The lesson  starts with covering the basics of API calls using GET and POST. It then explores
GET requests against a very simple API. It continues with POST requests to Statistics Denmark,
and concludes with a discussion of the package `danstat` as an alternative before offering
tools for working with some of the slightly exotic time formats returned by Statistics Denmark.

## Prerequisites

The lesson requires some prior knowledge of R and RStudio/Positron. Learners should have R and
Positron (or RStudio) installed on their computers. They will also need to be able to install
R packages from CRAN, create directories and download files.
See the [lesson website](https://kubdatalab.github.io/R-api/#software-setup){target="_blank"} for instructions on installing R and Positron.
